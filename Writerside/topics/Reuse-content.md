# Reuse content

To reuse a content snippet, you need to assign an id to it. 

The recommended way to manage reusable content is wrapping it into the 
<emphasis>snippet</emphasis> element and keeping it in separate library files. 
Library files are not linked to a Table of Contents, and preview is not built for them. 

To see what libraries there are in a project, press <shortcut key="GotoFile"/>
and start typing `lib`:

<shortcut key="GotoFile"/>  
<shortcut key="ShowIntentionActions"/>

<img src="find_file.png" alt="Find File"/>

For an example of an include, look into the following files:
- source: <ui-path>snippets-library.topic</ui-path>
- usages: <ui-path>second-instance.md</ui-path> and <ui-path>Add-semantic-elements-to-Markdown.md</ui-path>
