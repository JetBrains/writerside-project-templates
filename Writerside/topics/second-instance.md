# About Second instance

<include from="snippets-library.topic" element-id="instance"/>

Hold <shortcut key="CtrlCmd"/> and click `instance` (the value of `element-id`)
to go to the declaration of this snippet in <path>snippets-library.topic</path>.

From the library, hold <shortcut key="CtrlCmd"/> and click the snippet `id` value
to see all usages of this snippet and navigate to the one you need.

## Rename all usages at once

With the caret on the element id, press <shortcut key="RenameElement"/> to refactor the id:
rename it everywhere (both the declaration and all of its usages).
You can also use the <control>Rename</control> refactoring on other elements,
for example, on topic file names to ensure that all references remain valid.
